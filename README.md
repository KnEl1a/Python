This repository contains visualizations and data analyses developed for a research project at my university. The main objective of the project was to theoretically examine the trade relations between Mercosur and China, contrasting the claims with data and representations. It focused on planning and methodology, generally covering a time period from 2000 to 2019, **with the purpose of understanding how these trade relations impact our country economically**. Data from various recognized sources, such as the official Mercosur website, COMTRADE, FAO, and other relevant platforms, were used for data extraction.

<h3>Generally, the charts are saved in '.png' formats, and in the '.py' files, you can see the complete Python code, the entire algorithm for generating each visualization, in each folder "Graf. x"</h3>
<h5>Types of charts:</h5>
<li>Vertical bar histograms</li>
<li>Line charts</li>
<li>Pie charts</li>
<li>Horizontal bar histograms</li>
<li>Combination of scatter plots and line charts</li>
<li>Tree Maps</li>

## Data Sources: The datasets come from reliable and recognized sources, such as:

https://fpma.fao.org/giews/fpmat4/#/dashboard/tool/international

https://estadisticas.mercosur.int/

https://comtradeplus.un.org/

https://www.trademap.org/Index.aspx

**The Python 3.10 programming language was used through the Visual Studio Code IDE and Jupyter Lab. Currently, for practical reasons, I am using Jupyter Lab because it provides quick visualization and allows me to better adapt to problem-solving in my code.**

The data were subjected to an exhaustive cleaning and filtering process to ensure their integrity and relevance.
Data reorganization techniques were applied to optimally structure the information.

### Visual Representation:

**Tools Used**: I used the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating professional visualizations. Additionally, I used other libraries, specifically Seaborn and Plotly for certain charts.

In my humble opinion, this repository is a solid contribution to the understanding and visual analysis of trade dynamics between Mercosur and China.
